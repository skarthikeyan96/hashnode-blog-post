Hello ðŸ‘‹

In this blog, we will explore how to build a WhatsApp bot using Twilio, Node.js, Typescript, Render, and Gemini.

**Pre-requisites :**

* Have a Twilio account. If you donâ€™t have one, you can register for a [trial account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
    
* Install [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and make sure itâ€™s authenticated.
    
* Have a [OpenweatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) account and the API key
    
* Create a [Gemini Account](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and the API key
    

## Setting up the development environment

First create the directory `environmental-bot` and run this following command

```bash
npm init -y
```

Install the following dependencies to setup our basic node server. Later we will add the typescript to our project.

```bash
npm i express dotenv
```
