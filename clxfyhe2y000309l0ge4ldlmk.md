Hello ðŸ‘‹

Let's start with **Promise**

## One-Byte Explainer:

Promises are like a waiter taking your order. They handle results which can be either success or failure.

## Demystifying JS: Promise in Action

1. **Place the Order**: You give your order to the waiter (Promise).
    
2. **Waiter Takes Order:** The waiter takes your order (async task begins).
    
3. **Continue Waiting:** While waiting for the order (promise results), you can do other things (program continues to run).
    
4. **Food Arrives (or Not):** The waiter brings your food (success) or tells you there's an issue (error).
    
5. **React to Result:** Based on the result, if success, you enjoy the food; if error, you order something else.
