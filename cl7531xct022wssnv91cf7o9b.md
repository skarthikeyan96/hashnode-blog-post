## My Journey into technology - What made you want to be a developer?



Hello everyone, 

I will be sharing with you , my journey towards technology and How did I become a developer. This blog will be part of the first series on #4Articlesin4weeks. 

Quick intro about me before getting started.

*P.S This is my second non-tech article. This is my [first article](https://imkarthikeyans.hashnode.dev/my-journey-towards-technical-writing), if you would like to give it a read.*

# Level 1 - High School :

In my high school, I used to memorize computer programs for my exams. I was never interested in computer science ðŸ˜©. After finishing high school , I did not know what path to choose. My brother suggested me to choose computer science engineering. I was actually scared at first but I went for it finally.

**Spoiler Alert** : I am now very grateful that I trusted myself and went with choice. 

# Level 2 - College 

My parents bought me my first PC during my first year somewhere around mid 2013. Below is the configuration 

```
Processor : Intel i3 
Operating System: Windows 7
HDD: 500GB 
RAM: 4GB

```
When I first started my college, I was actually scared how I am going to get through this ? Then I thought , let's give it a shot. What could go wrong ?

My intuition turned out be right. I started to love coding , when I understood how computers process the information. The problems  which you can solve with help of code was also what reeled me into computer science field. 

I started learn to code using C and C++. Slowly started poking around internet to see what else I can do. I was fascinated by website animations and the portfolioâ€™s of other developers. I wanted to create a website for myself. That's when I started learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. I created a very basic website with some details. 

*P.S  Tried finding the site in my mail archives, misson was unsuccessful.* ðŸ˜”

I participated in one of the hackathon conducted by my college. The task was to  build an application to solve a problem under specific categories. 

The problem which our team was trying to solve was , we needed an interface where students can interact with teachers to clarify the doubts and also can submit assignments that can be evaluated by the teachers. 

I learnt PHP and MySQL and built a full stack application. Even though we did not win , the process and the learning was great. I got to learn new things ðŸ¥³. 

**Learning:** DO NOT build all the features for the application just focus on the MVP ( Minimum viable product ).

One more good thing that happened from the hackathon was , it steered me towards learning new things related to technology on my own, through practice.  That is actually the moment when I realised that choosing this field was the right decision.

**Learning**: When you solve programming problems , you might not get the logic in a day or 2 days or even a week. My suggestion would be is **do not give up**,  keep trying and keep solving easier problems daily.

# Level 3 - Career 

Now I am working as Software Engineer @ Granicus mainly focused on using web technologies to solve problems. I love every minute of it. Whenever I am not working , I focus on my health , learning new technologies and also sharing them with the community via blog. 

Thanks to the decision which I took in high school which has led me here. I am very grateful for that. 

Few learnings from my part which I would tell me younger self , before closing up. 

1. Be patient. 
2. Do not give up. 
3. Always be curious . 
4. Even if it is a small thing you learn , share it with community in the form of blog or a video, 

Thank you reading my story. Hope it was not boring and let me know your thoughts in the comments. If you would like to connect , I am available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/karthik_coder). 

Thank you 

Happy Hacking ðŸš€
